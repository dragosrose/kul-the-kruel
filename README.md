## Description

Kul-the-Kruel is a 2D platformer game developed in Unity. It follows a simple and intuitive gameplay. The 
character must navigate the level and avoid falling prey to the traps. This project was developed for the Software 
Development Methods Course at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics (FMI) of the University of Bucharest.

### Idea

The initial idea for the project was different, albeit not entirely. That which initially spurred the team into action was 
the opportunity to develop a game in Unity, using whatever resources were available. The initial idea revolved around a TV station 
and the woes of one of its presenters, faced with the difficulty of juggling ratings, popularity, censure and budget. Though inspiring, 
the feasibility of Krul-the-Krul won out in the end.


### Development Process

The team decided on a step-by-step approach, in an attempt to emulate the core philosophy of SCRUM. Such steps included:

* Preparing the setup (downloading Unity, editor installation, module installation)
* Designing and preparing the tilemap
* Developing the player character (adding movement and animations)
* Adding menus (start, character design selection and ending)
* Adding traps and player death logic
* Adding collectible items and counter
* Preparing the demo
* Writing the necessary documentation

This straightforward organization helped to create a smoother process and contributed to the team’s overall experience.


### Problems

Some hurdles were bound to be encountered along the way and ranged from technical issues when switching operating 
systems for development to task management. Nevertheless, the team managed to synchronize each member’s efforts in the end after 
having once again learned that it’s never smooth sailing in this profession.
